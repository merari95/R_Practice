```

Welcome to worksheet 6! This worksheet was designed to allow you to practice what was covered in the assigned readings & lectures/recordings. The labs problems will be more challenging than those in the worksheet, and the worksheet questions will help prepare you for them. Time will be provided to work on the worksheets in small groups during lecture, however it is not expected that you will complete the worksheet in this time. You are expected to spend some independent time working on the worksheet after lecture.

<mark>To ensure you do not break the autograder remove all code for installing packages (i.e., DO NOT have `install.packages(...)` or `devtools::install_github(...)` in your homework!</mark>

**Worksheets are due on Saturdays at 6 pm, and must be submitted as `.Rmd` file in this worksheet/lab to Gradescope.**

### Worksheet mechanics

-   **There is autograding in this lab, so please do not move or rename this file. Also, do not copy and paste cells, if you need to add new cells, create new cells via the "Insert a cell below" button instead.**

Run the cell below to load the libraries needed for this worksheet, and to check your answers as you go!

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(digest)
```

### Exercise 1

rubric={autograde:1}

Write a function called `mpg_to_kml` that takes a vector of numbers in miles per gallon units and converts it to a vector in kilometeres per litre.››\$

*Hint: 1 mile per gallon is 0.425144 kilometres per litre.*

```{r tags=c()}
mpg_to_kml <- function(x) {
   #this is the mpg_to_kml function that converts mpg to kml, if the input is not numeric, if it's a dataframe or a list, then an error will be thrown out respectively.
  
    # must not be data frame or list
  if (is.data.frame(x) || is.list(x)) {
    stop("Input cannot be a data frame or list.")
  }
  
  # must be numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be numeric.")
  }
  

  return(x * 0.425144)
}
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/e1.R")
```

### Exercise 2 (not graded)

*Solution posted at end of worksheet.*

Write **at least** two {testthat} `expect_equal` tests inside of an `test_that` statement to ensure that your function works as expected (i.e., do you get back expected values given your input values - is the math correct?).

*Hint: test edge cases that you can compute by hand, and be sure of your answer!*

```{r tags=c()}
test_that("Output is equal to 0.425144 when input is 1 ", {
  
   expect_equal(mpg_to_kml(1), 0.425144)
  expect_equal(mpg_to_kml(10), 4.25144)
  expect_equal(mpg_to_kml(0), 0)
  
})

#here i am testing that my function mpg_to_kml correctly converts pmg to kml by testing different input/outputs 
```

### Exercise 3

rubric={autograde:1}

Add exceptions to your `mpg_to_kml` function so that you can handle inappropriate user input, such as character vectors, lists or data frames.

```{r tags=c()}
test_that("Non-numeric values for input should throw an error",{
  expect_error(mpg_to_kml('hi'))
            }
          )
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/e3.R")
```

### Exercise 4 (not graded)

*Solution posted at end of worksheet.*

Now write **at least** two {testthat} `expect_error` tests inside of an `test_that` statement to ensure that your function works as expected (i.e., does your function throw errors when incorrect inputs are given?).

```{r tags=c()}
test_that("Invalid inputs should throw an error", {
  expect_error(mpg_to_kml("hi"))
  expect_error(mpg_to_kml(data.frame(x = 1)))
})
```

```{r}
mpg_to_kml(data.frame(x = 1))
```

### Exercise 5 (not graded)

*Solution posted at end of worksheet.*

Now write {roxygen2} style documentation for your function!

```{r tags=c()}
#' Convert miles per gallon (mpg) to kilometers per liter (km/L)
#'
#' This function converts fuel efficiency from miles per gallon (mpg) 
#' to kilometers per liter (km/L) using the conversion factor 1 mpg = 0.425144 km/L.
#' It includes error handling to ensure that the input is numeric, and is not 
#' a data frame or a list.
#'
#' @param x A numeric value or numeric vector representing miles per gallon.
#'
#' @return A numeric value or numeric vector representing fuel efficiency 
#' in kilometers per liter.
#'
#' @examples
#' mpg_to_kml(1)
#' mpg_to_kml(c(10, 20))
#'
#' @export


mpg_to_kml <- function(x) {

  # first check for data frame or list
  if (is.data.frame(x) || is.list(x)) {
    stop("Input cannot be a data frame or list.")
  }

  # then check if numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be numeric.")
  }

  return(x * 0.425144)
}

```

### Exercise 6

rubric={autograde:1}

Go on an R package scavengeR hunt! Explore one of the [`stringr` R package on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr) to do the following question:

Create a list that has the following four elements in the order listed below:

1.  The relative path (from the project root) to the file containing the `str_replace` function (as a character vector).

2.  The line number of the start of the `str_replace` function definition (not including the Roxygen2 comments) (as a numeric vector).

3.  The relative path (from the project root) to the file containing the tests for the `str_replace` function (as a character vector).

4.  The line number of the start of the first test of the `str_replace` function (as a numeric vector).

Bind the name `str_replace_metadata` to this list.

```{r tags=c()}
path <- '/tests/e6.R'
str_replace_metadata <- list(path, 10 )

str_replace_metadata
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/e6.R")
```

Congratulations! You are done the worksheet!!! Pat yourself on the back, and submit your worksheet to Gradescope!
